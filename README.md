## About butik

_**butik**_ is a Scandinavian term for a small to medium sized shop, precisely what this Statamic addon has been crafted for. The _Statamic Butik_ e-commerce solution will integrate nicely with your personal Statamic site and help to grow your online business.

You can use the light and simple design as shipped or customize it after your needs, to integrate it perfectly into your existing design.
